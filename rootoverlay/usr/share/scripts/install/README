Instructions:

1. New install:
Use the "forge" command:

	./scripts/ninjaforge.sh /dev/<sdX>

where sdX is the name of the block device, i.e. /dev/sdb sdc, etc.. You can
get this information from dmesg, disk manager, or other sources.

WARNING: This will overwrite the entire disk.

See ./scripts/ninjaforge.sh --help for more information.

2. Upgrade
Only use this on an existing version of Ninja OS. Double check partition sizes
are correct. We went to a new size with 0.8.x

NOTE: makeninja.sh is depreciated. This makes far more sense.

use the "--upgrade" command:

	./scripts/ninjaforge.sh  --upgrade /dev/<sdX>
