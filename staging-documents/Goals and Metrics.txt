This file is replacing the old Manual of Common Tasks, because well, that didn't
get the point accross to well.

Here is some of the design goals of Ninja OS. Please note we don't currently
meet all them due to our own limitations. These are merely goals.

Timing
------
Ninja OS is supposed to be as fast and responsive as possible:

Timings for boot and shutdown:

Boot - 15 seconds
shutdown - 5 seconds

Vision and goals
----------------
Overreaching goal of Ninja OS is to accomplish all the easy quick tasks one
might need a desktop computer for, on a single stick. Ninja OS is the 
"Operating System for Operators". Its 

1. Setup ready to use.
--All programs are setup to have the most common use case setup for default.
--All welcome screens and guides are disabled.(rip the tags off)
--All initializations complete. The Desktop is to be setup for both speed and
ease of use. Desktop shortcuts are created.

2. Light Pen Testing, and reconnassaince.
This is by no means a pen testing distro, but we add basic pen testing and
reconnassaince tools. Instead of lots of diffrent tools, a purpose driven set
of tools that work well together.

3. It Just works out of the box
As Many times
