signing all new package and the index is signed. Compiled from AUR pkgbuilds
and nominally tested.

This can be accessed online as an Arch Linux repository. simply add the

gpg signed, and the key is the same as the Ninja OS key used for other things.
You can find a package called ninjaos-keyring in AUR that will install this
automaticly.

unfinnished-scripts - not used scripts that do not get included when compiled
with the CD/USB stick.

cd-root - directory that is used as the root of the live medium, not in the
squashfs file.

rootoverlay - overlay that gets placed on top of root file system, everything
in here overwrites the installed files at the base location, and is relivant to
root "/" in the live system. 
Important files and locations in rootoverlay:

rootoverlay/var/liveos_version.conf - contains basic versioning information and
a SHA256 hash sum of the image displayed at boot.

rootoverlay/usr/share/scripts - directory contains scripts written by us for
use in this project. GPL licensed.

rootoverlay/var/lib/misc - directory contains files with hash sums of important
files not in the main squash container, for use with the integrity checker
script.

rootoverlay/var/interface - stores scrambled mac addresses for ethernet
interfaces with mh_scramble, as to make them persistant.

		----Modification and Redistribution----
All configuration files and scripts are licensed under the GPLv3, or any later,
version, except where noted. and you are free to modify and re-distribute
under those terms. I will dual license under GPLv2 if someone could give me
one solid good idea why I should. The following are guidelines:

Guidelines - if you are going to make ANY modifications that get re-distributed,
you are encouraged to add time, date and user handle stamps to code
modifications and change the versioning to reflect modification. such as
(ninja version)-(yourmod name)-(modversion). i.e. 0.5.3-pirate-7, for Ninja OS
version 0.5.3 with version 7 of the fictional pirate patch set.

If there are substantial changes, you should fork the project, and call it
something else entirely.
