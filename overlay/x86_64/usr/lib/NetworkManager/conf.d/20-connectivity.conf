#NetworkManager automaticly "checks the internet connectivity" of a connection
#by trying to connect to an arbitrary host on the internet and pulling some
#text. in Arch Linux, this connection was to an Arch Linux dev server.

#This is a really bad idea for a few reasons.
#1. Terrible for privacy. Automaticly flags your machine as Arch Linux
#running Network Manager. This is less than %.01 of all desktop machines, and
#by itself will be unique identifying information
#2. Fails connections to all networks not the internet. Personal intranets
#are now unnsupported.
#3. Captive portals will also fail as well. Using wifi on the road or in public
#networks is now unsupported.

# This file disables the stupid
